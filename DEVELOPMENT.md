# Development Log

## Project Setup
- âœ… Initialized React app
- âœ… Configured Tailwind CSS  
- âœ… Created component structure
- âœ… Created design prototype
- ðŸ”„ Working on WeatherCard component

## Challenges & Solutions

### Issue: Initial plan included Java Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, TensorFlow for a simple weather app
- **Cause**: Trying to showcase too many technologies without understanding appropriate use cases
- **Solution**: Simplify to React + JavaScript + API calls + Tailwind CSS
- **Learning**: Choose technology stack based on problem requirements, not resume padding

### Issue: Unclear about what makes a project good
- **Cause**: Focused on complexity over execution quality
- **Solution**: Prioritize clean code, good documentation, and working deployment over feature quantity
- **Learning**: Well executed and simple is better than poorly executed and complex

## Key Insights
- **Plan thoroughly**: Planning things out makes the development way easier
- **Documentation is key**: Helping others understand and keeping track of what you are doing
- **Keep it simple**: It's better doing one thing really good than multiple things poorly
- **Problem solving approach**: Do research - try solutions - document experiences

## Next Steps
- Focus on building clean, working components
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Create comprehensive documentation
- Deploy early and iterate
