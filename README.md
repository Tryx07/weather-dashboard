## What I Learned

- **Plan thoroughly**: Planning things out makes the development way easier
- **Documentation is key**: Helping others understand and keeping track of what you are doing
- **Keep it simple**: It's better doing one thing really good than multiple things poorly
- **Problem solving approach**: Do research - try solutions - document experiences
- **Naming matters**: Keep variable names consistent, meaningful and distinct
- **Learning by debugging**: Most insights came from **errors and debugging**

## Future Enhancements
